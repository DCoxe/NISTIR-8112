## Note to Reviewers




## Why GitHub

Ok, "Why GitHub?" you ask. For us, the choice was relatively straightforward. GitHub has been a mainstay of the development and standards communities for many years now, serving as a space for collaborative interaction, the epicenter for evolving open source software, and an essential component in every coder’s toolkit. It only seemed appropriate for us to engage where so much of our community already congregates and collaborates. 

Second, as a platform, GitHub has many unique characteristics that make it attractive as a place to develop this special publication. From its ability to support broad engagement, to excellent version control, and multiple avenues for collecting and receiving input—it is a robust forum suited to this type of document.

Overall, GitHub is the right tool for the job. 

Commenters are **STRONGLY** encouraged to collaborate with the team and other public participants via GitHub issues. See [this page](comment_help.html) for details on how to submit a comment to us.  We want to maintain a lean approach, so we are discouraging email and Excel files. We thank you in advance for your efforts to keep this process streamlined for the editors.
